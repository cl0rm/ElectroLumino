# ElectroLumino
Portable Mulit-Channel programmable EL wire driver featuring PWM

# Warning
EL Wire is driven with rather high voltages. Only play with high voltages if you know what you're doing!

# Idea
This will become a fancy EL wire driver to make shiny clothing.
It should fit into a pocket (so it will be more or less the size of a typical smart phone)
